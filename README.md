# DataStructures
Data structures in C++. This project will go over linked list, doubly linked list, and other types of data structures.

**Linked List**
--------------------
The first linked list cpp file will cover creating a linked list struct with a local head while the second cpp file goes over a linked list struct with a global head. Both go on to show how to implement print, insert (at start, end, index), reverse, and delete functions. As a bonus, both will also show how to print and reverse the linked list recursively.
