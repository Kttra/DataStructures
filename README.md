# Data Structures
Data structures in C++. This project will go over linked list, doubly linked list, and other types of data structures.

**Linked List**
--------------------
A linked list is a linear collection of data/value elements where their order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Each element instead points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.

The first linked list cpp file will cover creating a linked list struct with a local head while the second cpp file goes over a linked list struct with a global head. Both go on to show how to implement print, insert (at start, end, index), reverse, and delete functions. As a bonus, both will also show how to print and reverse the linked list recursively.

**Doubly Linked List**
--------------------
A doubly linked list is a linked data structure that has a set of linked nodes. Each node contains three elements: two link fields (pointing to the one behind and one in front) and one data field (usually an integer).

In the doubly linked list cpp file, the code covers inserting before the head, inserting at the end of the list, inserting after a specific node, printing the list, reversing the list, deleting a specific node, and deleting a node at any index.

**Stacks**
-----------------
A stack is a linear data structure where it follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order are LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out).

The source code will show an implementation of a stack as an array and as an object (linked list implementation).
